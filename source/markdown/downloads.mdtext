The latest stable release of Apache Traffic Server is 8.0.6, released on 2020-02-29.
In addition, we continue to support the v7.1.x LTS release train, currently v7.1.9
which was released on 2020-02-29. We follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)
scheme. The goal is to release patch releases frequently, and minor releases as needed.
Within the major versions, all such patch and minor releases are all compatible.

When downloading from a mirror, please be sure to [verify the hash and OpenPGP
compatible signature](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html).  To validate
the PGP signatures the [public keys from the release manager](https://archive.apache.org/dist/trafficserver/KEYS)
will be needed.  You can also
[browse through all releases](https://archive.apache.org/dist/trafficserver/)
and hash signatures.
